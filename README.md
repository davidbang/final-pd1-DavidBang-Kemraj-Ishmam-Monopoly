===================================================

Connect Four, is played on a 7x6 grid, where the goal is to get four pieces in a row. The files for the game are housed in the Connect4 folder, and offer two ways to play. by compiling and runnung the file Gui.java, one can play in a GUI with JButtons as the tokens and red and black pieces. The other option is to compile and run the Driver file, which permits playing directly in the terminal, with 'X' and 'O' as players one and two respectively. 

regardless of which interface is chose, no functionality is lost, and the game remains just as fun and challenging. 

At the moment there is no AI, thus only player vs. player is available, and there may be a few glitches in the GUI that were not caught during beta testing.

Thank you for playing, and enjoy!!



















Monopoly Stuff:


Swag.java was intended to be our interface file, but it does not compile and we cannot figure out why.
Look at GuiSample for a simple image of how the interface would have looked (but it does not work).

We planned to make this monopoly game as close to the original board game,
but we received alot of errors and more errors when we tried to correct it,

How we planned it to work:
A 4 player game with up to 4 human players and bot players to make up the players if there is a lack of 4 players,
A player will roll a 2 sided die and then continue to go around the board, buying properties and experiencing events,
A player will win the game when the other players run out of money.

Rules are:
Pass Go, then collect $200
If you land in Jail, you are stuck in jail into you get identical dice rolls
If you land on a property you can buy it if it is not owned and you can build houses if you have money,
If you land on an owned property, you must pay the owner the respective amount.
Community Chest and Chance Cards are drawn once you land on the correct square.
Houses can be mortaged for a loan, but your debt cannot pass your net worth or you are out of the game.

The winner is the last survivor with money.
